				<p>The Kiwanis Club was founded in Michigan in 1914 to be a vehicle for service in the community and beyond and to provide fellowship for those interested in providing service.  It was especially interested in children, and one of its first international projects was to combat childhood thyroid insufficiency.

				<p>Kiwanis International is a volunteer-led organization headed by a Board of Trustees consisting of 19 members: 15 trustees, four elected officers, and an executive director. The trustees serve three-year terms, with five trustees elected each year. As set out in the bylaws, nine trustees are elected from the United States and Pacific Canada Region, one trustee is elected from the Canada and Caribbean Region, two trustees are elected from the European Region, two trustees are elected from the Asia-Pacific Region, and one trustee is elected "at large" from any region other than the United States and Pacific Canada. The elected officers included (in order of progression): vice president, president-elect, president and immediate past president. These officers, along with the United States and Pacific Canada Region trustees, are elected at the annual convention of Kiwanis International. All trustees and officers are unpaid volunteers. The executive director is a full-time employee who is responsible for the organization's paid staff and serves as a non-voting member of the Board.
